Weathere
========

Too often, we evaluate the weather in an impersonal manner, measuring it on an arbitrary scale of degrees. Wouldn't it be better if we measured the weather relative to something we tangible, like the temperature in other cities? The answer is no, that would be dumb. But you can do that anyway, now, with "Weathere" - the app that tells you the weather There, wherever There may be. It's an experiment in looking at familiar data in a different way.
